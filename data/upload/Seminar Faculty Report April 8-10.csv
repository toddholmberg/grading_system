The tables were too small - it's always better to remake tables. That way you can focus on only the data you want to show and we can see them! They were in the handout, which was very useful, but they were even a bit small and busy there. It was nice to highlight the lines you were talking about on the slides (though I couldn't see the numbers from the back, then it was hard to figure out which lines you were talking about when I looked down to the handout to see the numbers - my fault for sitting at the back but worth considering for next time). Also, would have been nice to have the cost comparison data in the handout (instead of just AWP).",5,7,7,5,6,"The talk flowed well, but there were some things that you glossed over without explaining why. For example, the decision not to include acomprosate could have at least been defended slightly (i.e. maybe including it in the cost comparison and then saying that you wouldn't discuss its mechanism of action because it's clearly much more expensive, or something). Especially since that's the one treatment we're less familiar with.  /  / Also, I'd avoid saying that you were interested in the topic because your topic mentor suggested it.

Without a solid quantitative comparison, it's difficult to evaluate how similar the studies are. Also, having family involvement in the recall seems a strength instead of a weakness. If the other studies relied on patient recall for data collection, and that one study included both family and patient recall, it seems that the more people involved in remembering an event, the more accurate your data would be (or the more convoluted, but I don't think you can just write it off without more explanation).  /  / I always like to see some information about how many studies are out there on a topic. For example, study 2 was so weak and underpowered, that no real conclusions could be drawn from it. You probably should have just left it out. But it would be useful to know if these are the only 3 studies on the topic in the world, or if there are many more (and if so, why you picked these). ",5,5,4,5,"Your printed conclusions were evidence-based and conservative. But when asked in class, you went with topiramate. I think a prescriber would run into trouble prescribing topiramate because of the weakness of the evidence for this indication.

There need to be firm conclusions.  The statement for each that it ""shows great promise"" is not a firm conclusion.  There is either data to support its use or there isn't.
