Your eye contact was also excellent throughout the entire presentation.,7,7,7,7,I like that the font was large and the pages did not seem to be cluttered with insignificant details.

In the study by Mitchell for example you recognized that the population used was a smoking and drinking population and that was not necessarily indicative of what a normal drinking population would be composed of.  There were many factors there that could have acted as potential confounders if we blindly applied the study's results to the general population.  I thought it was very astute of you.,7,7,Great job with answering questions I liked how you hardly had to think about the ideal outcomes you would measure if you could have designed a study yourself.  I don't think you made time for questions throughout and I always enjoy that it just breaks up the presentation a little.,7,7,7,7,7,You really demonstrated a great overall knowledge of the topics when you clearly identified the limitations of the trials and how you would have changed them.

The organization was phenomenal and really made the topic easy to follow.",7,7,7,7,7,7,There was plenty of data but what I liked most about it was the way you used it.  You did not just put up a chart and let us wonder about its significance you explained in great detail why it mattered and used the data effectively to illustrate the points you were trying to make.  It was not an obstacle you were trying to overcome it came off more as a tool that bolstered your argument.,7,7,7,7,Everything was great your conclusions were seen at multiple points of the presentation.  It would have been nice at the end though to do a conclusion summary slide just to tie everything together and remind us of the main points again,7,7,You were really able to think on your feet quickly and theorize about where we need to make progress in this field.
