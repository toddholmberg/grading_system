The only criticisms I had in this section were she seemed to be rushing throughout most of the seminar and she turned her head back to look at the screen quite a bit so it was hard to hear at times when she was talking to the screen.  But these were minor issues that did not detract from her seminar.,7,7,7,7,"I think she did a good job of orienting her audience to charts and graphs.  Her slides were clear but a few of them, especially with the study data were a bit wordy.  ",7,7,7,7,7,I liked the case that she presented at the beginning that she followed through with at the end.  It helped to get us thinking about the topic and helped increase audience participation.,7,7,7,7,-,5,"Angela did a great job presenting her studies, especially since she had 5 studies to present.  My only criticism hear is that she didn't have study strengths in her slides or handout.  I know she was pressed for time, but the strengths could have been included in her handout if she didn't have time to mention them during her presentation.",5,7,5,6,"I wasn't really sure on her conclusion.  Is she recommending obese patients get higher dosing or BID dosing?  If so, at what dose?  I also felt the pharmacists' role section could have been more fleshed out, especially since this is the part that would be useful in clinical practice.",7,7,I felt the case was a very good was to increase audience enthusiasm and participation. ,7,7,7,7,7,I think it was clear Angela knew much more about her topic than what was in her slides and her handout.  To answer some of the questions the audience asked she had to draw on personal experience and background articles that were not presented.,,I really liked the case to improve audience participation.  I also liked the questions that were asked to not only address the controversy but to bring focus on the cases.,Maybe cut out one or two studies so that you wouldn't be so rushed during your seminar.,Overall I thought Angela did a great job on a topic that is obviously controversial and applicable to clinical care in hospital settings or long term care facilities.  She was very well poised and prepared for her seminar.  Great job!!  =)
