Would like to have seen some discussion regarding the fact that fish oil seemed to be more effective than an SSRI at treating depression.  This seems a bit hard to believe.  Not much in the way of discussion of the role of the pharmacist other than to say she would recommend fish oil to patients on antidepressants.  Would like to have seen a bit more discussion here.,4,1,Did not get much in the way of questions and did nothing to encourage the audience to interact.,4,4,2,1,1,there was little in the way of discussion that convinced the audience that she had knowledge beyond what was presented.  Did little to nothing to put these results in any context.,,the most important thing to work on for your next seminar is to rehearse your presentation in advance until you are very comfortable with it.  I would recommend writing your entire  seminar out so that you have a script for each slide to read.  You will know that you are ready to present when you can go thru the presentation and not read from your script.  This will go a long way to make you more comfortable presenting.
