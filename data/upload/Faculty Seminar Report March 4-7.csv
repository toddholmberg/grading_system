He maintained consistent eye contact with his audience and seemed to be engaged in conversation. He was easy to follow and he did not speed thru the content.  He provided appropriate gesturing.  He did not get flustered with the dysfunctional pointer.  ,6,6,7,7,"One spelling error was noted on the Alumni slide.  ""Alumni"" has 1 ""L"" and not 2 ""L's"".  He used boxes to highlight groups of data which made his slides easy to follow.  The slide dealing with the important question of the controversy was an excellent tool to provide continued transition into the topic at hand.  Nice touch.  Scott knew his slides very well and was very organized.  He used pictures to demonstrate IC bleeds to provide background for P1P2P3 audience which was very helpful.",7,7,7,7,7,"Scott did an enormous amount of work to build this seminar. As an audience member who is not an expert in coagulopathies, I felt that he offered a tether to keep me on track during the seminar because he really wanted his audience members to understand the controversy.  He provided excellent transitionary flow between outline headings and within topic sections.  Objectives were written with action verbs and were utilized and met.  He used a warfarin risk slide to bring the importance of patient safety home to the audience.  Excellent selection.  ",7,7,7,7,7,7,"Overall analysis of studies was thorough and presented to the audience in a manner that was easily understood.  One could walk away understanding the data.  Given the complexity of the data, I am not sure that everyone walked away with understanding how to use the information but it provided the audience with additional food for thought!  His own conclusions were well thought out and reflected a discriminating analyses of the authors.",7,6,6,7,Conclusions were based on analyses of the studies.  I would have liked to have heard what the experience has been for pharmacists and physicians at the U or other hospitals in the community regarding the FFP and PCC controversy.  This would bring a more practical aspect for the study versus the authors' conclusions.  The role of the pharmacist was outlined and easy to understand.,7,7,Scott was very comfortable with the topic and seemed excited to share with the audience.  He was ready for questions and seemed to have anticipated some of them which is good.  This reflects a broader breadth of his reading and exploration.  Please consider repeating the questions asked of the audience because it was very difficult to hear the questions asked from the back of the room.  This is a method utilized by poised speakers and reflects well on the speaker.,7,7,7,6,7,"Scott's presentation and Q/A session reflected that he had beyond basic pharmacology and the primary studies.  He was able to answer questions rather easily.  He also was able to answer questions which had less evidence and did so rather gracefully.  If he was unsure of the answer (because there was no answer due to less evidence), he was able to provide some primary literature to show a direction for the answer so the audience was not left empty-handed.  Overall, an excellent presentation.",,"Scott provided an excellent presentation.  He kept the topic stream-lined so that he would not ""lose"" the audience due to the complexity of the topic.  He did not add fillers to the presentation so he did not lose his audience's attention.  This quality will serve him well on rotations where physicians want succinct answers.  Scott also stood away from the podium to pose his conclusions to the audience.  This elevated his credibility in this topic and encouraged the audience to ask questions.

Jilbear spoke from a level of expertise which he wanted to share with the audience.  Eye contact was appropriate.  He needs to try to not keep his hand in his pocket.  He can definitely benefit from using more hand gestures to help him make his points.  The material presented was appropriate for the audience but he lost his audience on many of the statistical tests.,7,7,7,7,"Jilbear's slides had good color and were easy to read.  He had pictures which helped prevent slide show monotony.  He was consistent with table/graph orientation with the audience and his style, in doing so, was not clumsy.",7,7,7,7,7,"The introductory remarks were straightforward regarding the pathophysiology.  The audience was able to easily understand via his pathophysiologic pictures the importance of afib why, as a pharmacist, it was an important topic.  He provided appropriate background information and did so without providing the audience with full-text slides.  Jilbear used his slides as triggers so that he could speak from the slides and maintained the interest of his audience.  Prior to presenting his two controversial studies, he provided 2 introductory trials which were important to understanding the cost analysis concept for his upcoming 2 studies.  I thought this was a creative method of setting the platform for the upcoming 2 studies.  The picture-graph on QOL vs years was also very complimentary to his point and the studies.  The audience was ""walked thru"" the setup leading to the 2 studies.",7,6,5,6,6,6,"Jilbear provided clean summaries of the objectives, methods and results for each study. I would have liked to have seen an example of the European cost vs the American cost for the agents.  I found this information hard to grasp vs the currency.  I wasn't sure if the ""weakness"" had to do with the value of the Euro vs the Dollar.  A little confusing here. Also, does the social health care system of Europe have an impact (such as in Study 1) vs these European dollars.  The statistics were abit confusing.  Jilbear presented the data in a way that complimented his knowledge but I think the audience was struggling.  Since the audience was trying to grasp the statistical concepts and the seminar time was limited, I would have liked to have seen an appendix on possibly general definitions of the tests to possibly help the audience since there is alot of diversity between P1 - P3.",7,6,6,6,"Jilbear recapped the controversy at the end of the seminar.  He introduced future directions for use of this therapy.  Being that the risk associated with severe bleeding is very real, he should have provided the audience with some of his suggestions for ""what to do in practice"" should this occur.  He did mention that the reversal agent may be coming to market in 2 or 3 years.  Otherwise, the pharmacist's role was appropriate.",6,6,"Jilbear handled most questions easily.  The question from Renee dealing with what to do for the patient who is now severely bleeding was not answered by Jilbear.  Rather, the audience member provided the answer.  One way to help the speaker realize where the drug fits into practice and into the patient's lifestyle, is to speak with pharmacists and physicians who have worked with the drug and have practical applications with the agent.  These conversations can spark other areas of reading which are necessary prior to giving a seminar and can help with the anticipatory questions which may occur.",6,6,7,5,6,"The seminar preparation has definitely heightened Jilbear's knowledge base in the coagulopathy arena.  He demonstrated his expertise during the seminar and showed a genuine interest that his audience share his curiosity.  Jilbear understands the literature support/not supporting the topic.  In the future, he should also tap the professional resources in hospitals and clinics to see how the agent is being received in the practice setting.",,"Jilbear presented an excellent seminar which enabled himself and his audience to learn new aspects involving coagulopathy and the pharmacist's role.  I would recommend that the referencing of the appendix undergo some change.  Simply pasting the charts from articles onto a sheet is fine, provided that the charts are chronologically numbered and then referred in that sequence by the speaker to the audience.  It provides more order for the handout.  The appendix ends up being a landfill for some charts and sometimes reflects a similar organization.  The solution for this issue is very easy and can be tackled with the next seminar.  Thank you, Jilbear, for all your hard work to produce an  enjoyable seminar! ",40.76080322,-111.891098,-1
