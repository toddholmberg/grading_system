You had a nice, relatively relaxed presentation style, and excellent eye contact and rapport with your audience.   / Your voice was a bit hard to hear at times from the back of the room.  You might want to use a lapel mic to allow you to be heard more easily while still being able to come out from behind the podium. / You arrived late and started your seminar late.  While issues arise, when you are the presenter, you always want to err on being there very early, so that you can accommodate any delays in getting there.  It also shows the audience that you respect their time.  Additionally, it gives you time to collect yourself and be prepared, rather than having to rush in and start your presentation right away while out of breath.

Moving away from the podium can help you avoid the tendency to read off the screen. The presentation was just a bit short, you could have provided a more detailed analysis or added a case study or two to help drive home your conclusions. ",5,6,6,6,"Your slides and handout were good for the most part. One exception was some very small font on several slides (too hard to read, especially from the back). ",6,7,6,6,6,"Nice introduction, especially the info about your interest in the topic. I was a little confused by your description of your discussions with the physician - did she really say that she NEVER prescribes azithromycin because of the warning that pops up? Your objectives were quite strong, although you might want to narrow it down a little (to maybe 3 things you want the audience to remember).",6,5,6,7,7,4,"You did a nice job of summarizing the studies. Analysis of the studies was a weakness (that will become stronger with more experience, as mentioned in class). It would have been nice to see a more thoughtful analysis of the studies' strengths and weaknesses. ",6,4,4,5,"While your conclusions were supported by the data presented, I would have liked to see you put this into better context for us. We are looking at 15-85 affected patients out of 1 million. The NNT would have been useful, as would a comparison with other drugs notorious for causing long QT. Is this a pretty minor risk, or are they all this minor?  ",5,5,"You got some hard questions, and generally answered well, but were hesitant to step beyond what you'd covered and make a strong conclusion. This is a topic that a community pharmacists undoubtedly encounters fairly often, so you need a strong and determined answer. You did get some good feedback from the audience during the Q&A.  ",5,4,5,4,4,"You seemed really hesitant to draw a firm conclusion. A case study (or two) illustrating when you would and would not want to change the antibiotic would have been useful. It's OK to take a stand. In this case, it seems like, for the vast majority of patients, there should be no concern. And for a few, azithromycin should be avoided. ",,"Overall, great topic choice, nice first seminar, good job! For next time, you can work on adding more of your own analysis to the mix (strengths and weaknesses of the studies, clinical relevance and applicability, etc.) and taking a stand in your conclusions."

Also, the objectives were too subjective - hard to tell if the audience met the objectives at the end. ",6,6,6,6,6,4,"You presented the studies nicely, but we need some context. Why did you choose these studies? Is this all that is out there? If so, does that tell you something about the utility of this treatment? If not, are these the best available? ",5,5,5,5,"Your conclusions were supported by the data presented, but the data were weak. Because of this, it leaves the audience wondering whether this has any clinical applicability or relevance. ",5,5,"You did fine with the Q&A, but next time, dig a little deeper so that you'll have a slightly broader knowledge base to be prepared for questions. ",5,5,5,4,5,It would have been nice to put this seminar into context better. Does this really have a place in therapy? Is it a benign enough treatment that you would just recommend it to everyone? Do you expect to see any real results in the larger population? Will the low dose you recommended have any effect (compared to the higher doses in the studies)? ,,"Overall, nice seminar. Tough topic, tough data. For next time, you could work on putting the seminar into context - where does this treatment fit in the broader picture? Also, be careful about speaking precisely - at one point you mentioned that coconut oil had been used as the placebo because there were no fatty acids in coconut oil. Of course this isn't true, but there is just no EPA or DHA. "
