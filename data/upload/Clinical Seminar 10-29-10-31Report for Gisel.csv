She was not glued to her slides. She understood the educational level of her audience and was therefore able to present without having to include needless detail. She spoke professionally and she enjoyed sharing her information with the audience. Kelsey demonstrated good tone, volume, pace and enunciation.",6,7,7,7,"Some of the green highlights of numbers were difficult to see from back of room.  The green arrows were easy to see. Please note that the ""charts with boxes"" as noted by speaker are actually called ""histograms"" and would help spruce up sophistocation for types of graphs/charts. Slides contained highlighter markers like arrows, circles, etc to help speaker make a point.  Instructional style was easy to follow.  ",7,7,7,7,7,"Seminar, overall, demonstrated appropriate preparation with attention to numerous details. Seminar was appropriately rehearsed so that speaker was very aware of her slides and content. Good transitional flow between studies was given.  Kelsey did a nice job to explain NNT using examples from the 2nd study which I think is always helpful, and, especially for the P3 students.  She provided a very detailed list of strengths & weaknesses for the studies and provided comments regarding external validity which was important for audience understanding, especially for the P3 class.  Kelsey was able to provide these side explanations in a professional manner without speaking down to any groups.  Nice job.",7,7,7,7,6,7,"Again, please see the prior box of comments which would also apply here.  More comment might have been helpful regarding the stratification of groups, even if this task was not performed by the authors.  It's ok to comment on pertinent negative aspects of the study. Kelsey did a nice job providing useful information regarding how the results of these studies can be applied NOW to patient care.  The audience was actually able to leave the seminar with helpful outcomes to apply to practice.",7,7,7,7,Practical aspects regarding the outcomes of each study were then applied to practice.  Good work. (Please see prior text.),7,7,Kelsey asked questions intermittently thru the seminar which was great!  Audience took advantage of those breaks in the seminar to ask questions.  Kelsey also repeated the questions prior to providing answers which was a very professional move on her part!

She shares the knowledge in a way that the audience feels invited to take part in the conversation.  She was not swayed by the questions she did not have answers; she said that she would get back to the audience member with the answer (be sure to do so!!).  She mentioned that there was one statistic (sorry, I can't remember which one!) that she did not understand (and she looked over to Dr.Biskupiak).  I would recommend to not apologize for a lack of knowledge on the statistic.  Once the concept is stated, it opens another can or worms which the speaker may not want to pursue.  :)    Kelsey demonstrated poise during the seminar and did a great job!

The lack of eye contact with the audience was a distraction because I did not feel the speaker was talking to me, an audience member.  He spent much time looking at the slides and talking to the slides. Terrill needs to be more aware of his body positions.  He kept one hand partially in a pocket with fingers hanging out which was a distraction and created more of a more than casual atmosphere which is not appropriate for a formal graduate seminar.  I am not aware of the actual dress code for seminar as to whether dress pants, shirt, etc are recommended.  Terrill also crossed his arms during the seminar which demonstrated defensive posturing (which I am sure he was not even aware) or ""what should I do with my arms?"".  I would recommend to Terrill to gesture more with his hands to the audience.  This will improve his eye contact with the audience, will give his arms ""something to do"", and won't create unnecessary distractions for the audience (and is very easily remedied).",7,7,7,6,Nice use of colors on slides.  Highlighting colors were appropriate and easy to see from the back of room.  The  CDC map of obesity prevalence over the years was really an eye opener and was a smart idea to include this slide.,5,7,7,7,5,"The seminar introduction lacked a reasoning as to why this topic was important to the speaker and the profession. I think the introduction was longer than needed.  The information was helpful to the seminar outline but I think it might be pared down to spend more time on the studies. Since only 3 studies exist in the world literature, according to the speaker, there would have been time for this 3rd study presentation. The review of the BMI was helpful for the audience since the term is tossed around alot!  It was also helpful for the P3 students too.  I would not recommend starting the introductory remarks for 2 studies at one time.  It was confusing.  Once the format was introduced, it was not continued for the remaining discussion of the two studies and essentially backfired on the speaker.",7,7,7,6,6,6,Terrill needed to make it more clear to the audience as to why the selected studies were presented to the audience.  Why were these studies important? The question was asked as to where these studies fit within the world's literature.  The audience did not have a feel for the breadth of that literature base and a few sentences to address this issue would have been helpful.  Terrill jumped into each study without explaining why these studies were important to his topic.  Why was the 2nd study selected and how would the results of the 2nd study contribute to those of the first study? Attention to these issues will also help transitional flow between studies.  Terrill provided intermittent opportunities for questions for the audience during the seminar which was great and this allowed for an interactive component.,7,7,6,6,"I think Terrill could have used more energy to present the final conclusions of his seminar.  This is a great opportunityi to step away from the podium, look at the audience, and state these conclusions and how they apply to our practice sites.  How do these conclusions impact our counseling of patients?  Being that behavior modification was not utilized or discussed with these studies, is there a role in our practices or do we just rely on the drugs?  What are the remaining areas for research here?  I think the opportunity was missed to really lay it out for the audience (and have fun while doing so!).",6,7,Questions were asked intermittently thru seminar which allowed for some little breaks in the seminar. Terrill was not inhibited by the questions asked.,6,6,6,6,6,"Overall, I think the seminar presentation was good but needs more stylistic work with content and physical presentation. The topic is definitely an important one for practice with the increasing weight trends noted in the US.  Terrill definitely put alot of work into his seminar but I think it could have used alittle tweeking to make it a great seminar.",,Please see my various comments in the above text.  Thank you.  I enjoyed the seminar and the importance of this topic in practice.

Overall, you slides were well done.  I would suggest adding color to your slides to make them more interesting and also allow you to highlight specific key points.  Be sure to orient your audience to your graph and tables when highlighting specific points. I would suggest adding the controversy and overall conclusions to your handout despite them being in your slides.  These are key points that your audience will look to both during and after your presentation.",5,4,4,5,3,Your interest in the topic was a bit unclear or at least I missed it.  You also started right off with your controversy.  I would suggest giving some background before doing that so that your audience has a frame of reference to draw from with respect to your topic.  Also you controversy is a bit unclear as weight loss and binge eating are completely different disorders and could be separate seminars. You utilized questions for your transitions.  Be sure to wait for a few seconds for your audience to think about what question that they would like to ask.  ,6,6,5,4,5,4,"You did a solid job overall presenting your studies.  Be sure to discuss whether or not that your studies had adequate power to detect differences.

Be sure to discuss why you selected the trials that you did for this topic.  If the Jain et al. article the most current as it is 11 years old?  ",5,4,4,4,"You did not provide an over conclusions section in your handout but did so in your slides.  This is important to have in both places because this is the last thing that your audience will see.  In addition, it is what you want them to remember.  I would also suggest being more specific regarding your recommendations to state exactly what types of patients and when you would recommend this therapy.

Also, be sure to give your audience time to ask questions during your transitions.",4,4,4,4,4,"Overall, you need to be sure to demonstrate that you are the expert on your topic.  Be sure to understand and possibly point out statistical vs clinically significant outcomes.  You answered one of your questions where the reduction in weight was only 4 lbs.
