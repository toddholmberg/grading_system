It would have been nice to see you step out from behind the podium to ""engage"" with your audience; and speaking with more confidence would probably enable you to project your voice better.

Work on eye contact and readability of key information in slides. A main critique is on the flow.   While the study data was presented well, presenting the meta-analysis data at the end seemed to do more to support conclusions than the data presented.  Suggest using meta-analysis to demonstrate what is known and what gaps remain, and then use the data from the studies to help fill the gap and move closer to resolving the controversy."
