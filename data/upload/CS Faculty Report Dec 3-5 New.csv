Your recommendation to document pharmacist interventions is spot on. But exactly what those interventions should be is hazy.

Style was engaging, but perhaps a little too informal with language for a formal presentation.  Precision in language is always necessary for a formal presentation.  For instance, throughout the presentation, used 'flu' rather than 'influenza,' 'strand' rather than the correct term, 'strain.' ",4,6,6,3,"Many slides were easy to read, but some had noticeably small font and too many words to easily read in the time allotted to do so.  Also, there were some referencing difficulties.  APA format is not typical for a presentation or article in the medical sciences, but I suppose not technically wrong.  I did not see references for many of the pictures pulled from the internet or dates accessed (e.g. on slide 3).  References on slides in general were in such small font, they were not readable from the back of the room.  I recommend including references in the largest font possible.  I try for 20 pont font, but accept smaller font when it's absolutely necessary.  In addition, when I went to the handout to find the reference information that I couldn't see well on your slides, I noticed a reference that did not have the page numbers included (Kieninger, 2013). ",6,6,6,4,6,"Very engaging style, so no problems with flow. I felt that your comment about some seminar topics being esoteric was--although true--could perhaps be alienating to your audience. Good descriptions overall of some rather complicated information about influenza in the background, but the error on your slide that seemed to indicate that only influenza type A has hemagglutinin and neuraminidase was problematic.  ",6,6,6,6,-,5,"I felt that you did a nice job describing the geometric mean and a Monte Carlo simulation.  This was a section, however, where there were largely too many words on each slide, making keeping up difficult for me.  I would recommend putting the key results that you want to highlight on a separate slide to make them stand out to the audience.  ",4,5,5,4,"There was not a clear rationale provided to support your conclusion.  This came out in the Q&A, but really should have been included in your presentation.  The relatively large number of questions about the conclusion highlighted the audience's lack of clarity on how and why you came to that conclusion.  The role of the pharmacist did not specifically relate to the clinical question at hand.  Pharmacists are involved in the allocation of influenza vaccine within health systems and really should have been included.  ",5,6,I felt that questions were encouraged.  Some difficulty answering some questions.  ,5,5,5,5,5,"I felt that you were knowledgeable about the topic area overall, but the error in the background and the difficulty answering some questions introduced some question about the depth of knowledge in this area.",,Engaging style. Top recommendation is to work on supporting that conclusion.

Unclear if I missed this discussion, but if not, it is helpful to include why the studies presented were chosen and if there are additional data not presented.",6,4,5,7,"Conclusions seemed appropriate, but seemed to lack how these data are applied to current practice.  The implications of false positive PSA measurements in practice was not thoroughly discussed which, if explored, might have changed your conclusion to some degree.  A discussion with multiple clinicians in this area may have strengthened your conclusions.  Conclusions could also be more specific (which was brought out somewhat with questions).
