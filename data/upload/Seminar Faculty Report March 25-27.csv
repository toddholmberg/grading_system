Objectives can be articulated a little bit higher level, e.g. using words such as ""assess"", ""evaluate"", etc. Appropriate to show the chemical structure of Buprenorphine, and articulation of showing the receptor site as well as the formulation used. The small box on the top right corner helped the audience to orient where you are in the presentation flow. Very helpful to list a chart and the methods used/visual. Very thorough discussion of strengths and limitations as well as the study design."

Felt a bit rushed.  Good rapport with audience and good eye contact.,6,7,7,6,"For this room, would be good to have less white space at top of slides and to move text/items up so the content can be seen more readily.",7,7,7,6,7,Good identification of objectives and controversy.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more pathophysiology of epilepsy/seizures and what the hypothesized effects of this music is on the brain.  More mechanism.,7,7,7,7,7,7,"Good discussion of power and generalizability.  Could have provided a bit more clarity/information on graphs, particularly the results from the 1st study.",6,7,7,7,You waffled a bit about whether there is an effect or note.  I would have liked you to be bolder in your statement of your conclusions.,7,5,Didn't really stop/ask for questions during the presentation.  Did a good job answering the questions.,6,7,7,6,7,Would have liked to see broader discussion of the proposed effects of music on the brain -- a bit more detail on what's currently known/hypothesized in the field regarding mechanism.,,Well done overall!

Again also, the issue of clinical vs. statistical significance.",5,4,"Could know the details of the study a bit better (e.g. question about whether patients were on insulin or not).
