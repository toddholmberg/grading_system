Would you proactively discuss this with patients or wait until they ask? What would you tell them? ",4,6,"Based on your personal interest in the subject, I expected a deeper and broader level of knowledge about the topic. ",4,4,4,4,4,"See previous comment. It's probably wise to avoid going into detail about your own asthma experiences when talking with patients if those personal experiences include significant non-adherence and spotty checkups! I'd imagine it's much more useful to tell a patient ""Yes, I have asthma, and even though it's difficult sometimes, I follow my dosing schedule as close as possible and see my doctor regularly"". If the truth is ""Yes, I have asthma, and often miss doses and haven't seen my doctor in years"", it's better to keep that to yourself. Because the patient will see that and think - here's a medical professional who seems healthy and doesn't do what the doctor says - why should I worry about strict adherence?",,"Interesting topic choice, clear personal interest. I liked the way you showed the data leading to the black box warning and additional studies indicating that LABAs may be safe. A more rigorous analysis of the data, coupled with a broader knowledge of the general subject and excluding detrimental personal experiences would have strengthened the seminar and the conclusions we can take from it."R_42eKUeC4k39ZbMh,Default Response Set,"Ruble, Jim",u0035171,Jim.Ruble@hsc.utah.edu,155.98.228.211,0,11/11/13 8:46,11/11/13 9:35,1,188,6.266666667,1.112106834,,9,6,7,7,7,"Shayley demonstrated very good pace and professionalism with her presentation.

As an audience member it was difficult, at the beginning to remember that SVT was superficial venous thrombosis and not supraventricular tachycardia.  I cannot think of a better way to abbreviate superficial venous thrombosis, but it took some getting used to.",6,6,7,6,6,7,I have good confidence in Shayley's ability to critique the literature.  I think she achieved balance between packing details into the written handout and orally discussing those details with particular relevance to the controversy.  ,6,6,7,6,"Part of the difficulty with this section is that one of the studies was for a drug that is not approved for use in the US.  Automatically, that causes some pause and reflection on how, exactly, that impacts pharmacy practice.  I suppose it is something to watch for.  Generally, I think Shayley did a very good job organizing and discussing approaches to therapy on this particular controversy.",6,7,"Had a couple of I'll get back to you responses, but I think she did a good job responding to questions.",7,6,7,6,6,"Yes, Shayley demonstrated good overall knoweldge on the subject.

He came across as slightly anxious during the presentation.  Tended to stand right at podium and read from slide notes on the computer.

Oral presentation is a difficult social event, but repeated practice does help.",6,6,6,6,Instructional materials were put together well.

These discussion always provide lots of gray areas and lend themselves to great discussion.",6,6,7,5,6,6,"Joel handled the studies pretty well.  The studies all seemed quite different in their methodologies and what their outcomes were.  Accordingly, there was increased difficulty relating these back to the controversy.  I think Joel could have utilized the concept of discussing how each study contributed to a particulary objective of the presentation.  I think that is was Joel was trying to do.  However, with audience members, such as myself, who are somewhat slow, it is best to be obvious and overt with the relationship of study info to presentation objective.",6,7,6,6,"Seems like the big impact/role for the pharmacist was to become more aware of the issue and possibly politically active on this topic.  Also, possibly to advocate for these items being BTC and an opportunity for pharmacist to educate.",7,6,"Not as a fault to Joel, but the audience generally ran away with questions.  I think that reflects the ethical dilemmas presented in this topic.  It also shows this is an area that pharmacy could make a tremendous impact.  Overally, Joel did good with the question session.  ",7,6,6,6,7,Joel has a good knowledge base on this topic.  Some other areas identified during the q/a session include storage and temperature excursions.  These would also be good to incorporate into the presentation if it is presented again.,,"Joel did a very good job with this seminar.  His materials looked very good.  He provided great opportunities for thoughtful discussion.  Only significant opportunity to improve is practicing the presentation delivery and eye contact with the audience.
