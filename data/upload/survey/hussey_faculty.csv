The pace was a bit fast, sometimes a little rushed, in the future take time to pause as discussed in class.  Avoid using notes in the future, they are sometimes used as a crutch when they're not really needed.  Be confident; you know the material.  Notes tend to distract the audience and reduce how the audience perceives the speaker (ie, the speaker may not appear as knowledgeable as they are).  To avoid looking at the slide, you can stand behind the podium and view the monitor.  Would recommend using animation or other device to point out parts of the slide rather than pointing to it with your hand.  ",4,7,6,6,"The slides were easy to follow, but were a bit wordy.  Try to reduce the number of words per bullet point and only include major points.  Lengthy text can be reserved for the handout.  The handout was organized, but I felt wasn't as useful as it could be.  It was not easy to follow with the presentation for me, and the study data was not easily retrievable (eg, appendices with results data).  Try to develop a thorough, but succinct handout for your next seminar that an audience member could take with them and use as a reference whether they were present for your seminar or not.  ",7,6,5,5,7,"Good flow to the presentation and appropriate pauses for audience questions.  The introduction was informative and interesting, although there were many objectives which were pretty wordy, so I didn't catch them all during the presentation.  Develop better objectives next time that are not ""low level"" (eg, compare and contrast vs. describe).  Additional background may have been helpful as this isn't a topic covered well otherwise in the curriculum.  The presentation was short, so you had additional time to do this.  Remember when you practice, a presentation is often a little longer than when you actually give it (especially for you since you speak quickly).  Timing is important and will need consideration for your next seminar.  ",7,7,6,6,7,6,"NIce job describing the data and your interpretation.  Stats were discussed, not in great detail, but you did explain why a statistical test was important.  Strengths and limitations were described well.  In the future, rather than the traditional strengths and weaknesses slide, you may want to consider discussing while you describe the study and bullet the most important in a summary slide for that study.  ",7,6,6,6,"Interesting format to give us your conclusion first.  I enjoyed this and felt it set up your seminar nicely.  Just slow down a bit and use simpler bullet points so it's clear.  Recommendations for pharmacy were thorough, and it was nice to include both inpt and community recommendations.  Additional points may have included more reference material on picking an appropriate herbal brand/product and what safety data/DI data are available for melatonin (touched on after a question but probably warranted a slide).",7,7,"Excellent job with questions.  ",7,5,6,5,7,"Knowledge base was good and you were obviously prepared.  I would have liked a little more discussion of clinical vs. statistical significance regarding fertilization rates vs. actual pregnancy and what the numbers really meant in the studies.  There also could be more background or a summary of current research/studies of other antioxidants etc and maybe more info on why melatonin was the one of most interest.  ",,"Good first seminar.  Interesting topic.  "
