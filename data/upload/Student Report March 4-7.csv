The only complaint that I have was that she discussed that she thought they may have been made up of mostly the same patient population, but did not really explain how this may affect the big picture of the two studies and if they should be considered more as a single study with different phases or as the individual studies. I just would have liked a little more discussion on the implications that would follow them being the same patient population and how that would affect the take-away message from the two studies. Another aspect that I thought that could have used a little more explanation was the ""+/-"" when it cam to the means and medians of treatment doses as these ""+/-"" values were quite large relative to the average dose and how this may impact the results.",7,7,7,7,I liked that she was able to look at the studies critically. She was able to take their results and convey them while still being able to call into question some aspects of the study design. Her recommendation seemed appropriate but she let it be known that there would need to be more studies done before the results could be fully accepted.,7,7,She did encourage audience involvement during her seminar. She presented a case and continued it throughout the seminar which was nice. She was bale to answer the questions from the audience and was able to think on her feet.,7,7,7,7,7,She displayed a good knowledge of the subject and was able to look at the studies with a crfitical eye and call into questions some of the aspects of the study which I really liked.,,"Overall she did a good job. She displayed knowledge of the subject, personal interest, and critical examination of the studies which all greatly added to her seminar.","I would have liked to see a little more discussion of the areas of concern in regards to the studies that she pointed out, and how these may affect how we interpret the results. She also could have moved away from the podium a little more throughout the presentation. These are just minor areas that could have been improved upon and did not greatly diminish the overall seminar.",I enjoyed the seminar. I thought she was able to critique the studies well and was able to point out the difficulties of studying this disease state. I also liked that she was able to show interest in the subject on a level that most all of us are familiar with. ,40.70869446,-111.7143021,-1
