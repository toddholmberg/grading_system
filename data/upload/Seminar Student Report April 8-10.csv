When he got there he often paused and didn't go over everything that was on the slide.  Why put bulleted materials on the slide if you aren't going to discuss it?,1,1,1,1,I thought this was the weakest area of the seminar.  Everything appeared as though it was a rough draft.  There were several misspellings throughout the handout and slides.  The spelling was so bad that the title of the second study had misspelled words.  This is a point on professionalism: if you aren't going to put in the time to put up a good product how can you expect students and faculty to take the seminar seriously?  ,7,5,6,4,4,Flow was really good.  Room for improvement would be in transitioning between the background and the studies.,5,5,5,6,5,5,The speaker covered all of these topics within the study.  I think a more clear discussion of the limitation could have been made.  I had the same question as Dr. Orderda about the P values in the secondary outcomes.

This was very confusing to the audience.,5,5,The speaker was able to answer questions about the studies and did not shy away from them.,5,3,5,5,5,"I think the speaker did have knowledge beyond the facts; however, it was not always clearly discussed and succinct in nature.

It all felt incomplete and put together at the last minute.,"I had a hard time giving a score of higher than a B on almost all areas because I feel as if I saw the final product at 80% complete.  I felt that the speaker did not put adequate time into the project to deserve a passing grade.  When there are such egregious errors such as spelling mistakes within the titles of the studies in both the handout and slides how can one feel comfortable presenting?  I felt as if my time was wasted this afternoon.  I have always appreciated the effort people have put forth into their seminars and applaud them for their effort.  Because I felt the effort was not there, I can't say that this was a successful seminar."
