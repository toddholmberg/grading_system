You had a nice, relatively relaxed presentation style, and excellent eye contact and rapport with your audience.   / Your voice was a bit hard to hear at times from the back of the room.  You might want to use a lapel mic to allow you to be heard more easily while still being able to come out from behind the podium. / You arrived late and started your seminar late.  While issues arise, when you are the presenter, you always want to err on being there very early, so that you can accommodate any delays in getting there.  It also shows the audience that you respect their time.  Additionally, it gives you time to collect yourself and be prepared, rather than having to rush in and start your presentation right away while out of breath.  Don't be late again for such a presenation.",7,7,6,7,"Slides were pretty good, particularly given poor set up of 2110.  While they still had a lot of text, you added graphs and tables and also cut down and bulleted the lists/material -- that was well done. / Good job orienting the audience to the graphs of CV risk with age.  You did this as well for the data for your studies, but I didn't think you were quite as thorough/good in that case.  Also, it's hard to quickly pick up the red pointer dot on the white screen, particularly when your ""circling"" with it/moving it around.  Since it's a pointer, point with it -- don't move it all around -- steady point to allow your audience time to figure out where it is in the screen and what specifically it's pointing to.",7,7,7,6,7,"You did a great job reviewing patient care, and I liked how you used a patient case to introduce the topic and the question.  A few times you commented on the ""new guidelines"" and it wasn't clear to me specifically what the difference was between the old guidelines and the new guidelines.  It would have been nice to have a slide contrasting the old and new guidelines.",7,7,6,7,-,7,"I would have liked to see a bit more in-depth commenting on why you thought the stats were appropriate; that is, talk about the type of data being measured and then link that to why specific test ""X"" is appropriate. /  / You didn't really address withdrawals and dropouts -- there were some, but I think for the question being ask and the ultimate sample sizes, this was appropriate.",7,7,7,7,Good.,7,6,"You didn't really stop to ask for questions during the presentation.  It would have been good to do so; for example, after each main section.  However, you did engage the audience by asking them questions and giving them the little quiz about what the patient's risk factor is likely to be.",7,7,7,7,7,"You did a good job presenting the material and also answering questions.  It was clear from how you handled the questions that there was, as you said, more knowledge in your head than was reflected on the slides.  When queried about the studies already done and about what you would want to address in the future, you did a great job expounding upon what's already known in the literature and what still needs to be clarified.",,Well done.
