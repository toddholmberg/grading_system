Soliciting questions earlier in the presentation would have been nice, especially in the instance where an audience members question went unnoticed for a time.",7,7,7,7,7,"I thought the background section may have been a little long and drawn out; but it turned out to be important to understanding the quadrivalent and trivalent points. Perhaps a more concise summary would have improved the presentation. You demonstrated a good knowledge base during the Q and A, but some items you had to look up; you can't know everything and I thought that response was appropriate.",,I liked the presenters use of casual style and language to help the audience feel comfortable. Good use of humor and images.,"For me, the data seemed a little bit hard to follow in the trials. More explanation of the clinical significance of the outcomes and greater discussion about how the costs were calculated in the third study would have helped tremendously.","In the Q and A section, it was asked who would have the highest priority to receive a limited supply of quadrivalent vaccines. You said that it would be on a first come first served basis. Like the professors had hinted at, there must be some criteria (for example, inclusion criteria of the studies) to differentiate how this would be used. Perhaps it is a question to research further, it seems pretty relevant to pharmacy practice in dispensing quadrivalent vaccines."

With new health care legislation flu shots are supposed to be covered by insurance. Some insurance, however, does not cover getting the vaccination at a pharmacy so this information was very helpful. ","Your objectives could be more concrete. Use words that are easily measurable instead of vague words like ""understand"" or ""know."" These words are open to interpretation whereas statements like ""identify three points"" is measurable.",Now that pharmacists can provide vaccinations this is a very relevant topic.

He showed real interest in the subject and made recommendations that did not blindly follow the study results. He concluded that there may be benefit but until there is an available high quality product it would be best not to fully recommend it. He also spoke in regards to the different ethnic groups and populations in the studies that were underrepresented which I thought added more credibility to the presentation.,"I did find myself at times flipping through the pages to figure out where we were as sometimes it seemed that the presentation and handout were not on the same page, no pun intended, which I think could have been improved upon.","I enjoyed the presentation and his enthusiasm, he seemed to have carefully contemplated the results and knew the material.
